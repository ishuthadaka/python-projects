These are python projects about: 1.Railway booking system management,This Python code simulates a basic railway booking system. It uses a Train class to store information about each train, including its number, name, available seats, and a dictionary to track bookings. The system allows users to view available trains, book seats for specific dates, and cancel existing bookings. It validates user input, such as date format and seat numbers, and provides clear messages for successful operations and errors. The bookings data is stored in memory, and the system uses a menu-driven interface for user interaction. A key improvement is the use of the datetime module for date handling and validation, along with better organization using classes and methods.
Bank management system: The project file contains a python script (main.py) and a database file. This is a simple console based system which is very easy to understand and use. Talking about the system, it contains all the basic functions which include creating a new account, view account holders record, withdraws and deposit amount, balance inquiry, closing an account and edit account details. In this mini project, there is no such login system.
calculator generation:This Python code creates a command-line calculator. It presents a menu of arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide). The user inputs their choice and two numbers. The code performs the selected calculation, handling potential errors like invalid input and division by zero. It continues to loop until the user chooses to exit. The if __name__ == "__main__": block ensures the calculator function runs only when the script is executed directly.
